  <h3>Beyond the known face of an actor. <br> A small tribute celebrating his life which was much more than just being a star actor.</br>
SSR - A Photon in a double slit!</h3>
  <h4>Young's double slit experiment, particle-wave duality of Photon, and Sushant Singh Rajput.
  <br></br>
<br>One who embraces the realm of quantum mechanics, and the ever mystifying, mind boggling truth of dual nature of Photon, would find this short-tribute reflecting all which he essentially meant about his life.</br> 
<br></br>
Besides being a wonderful actor, he was in love with astronomy. A person who could talk for hours about astrophysics, quantum mechanics and cosmology with equal interest as about the world of cinema. A man who would jump with equal excitement for a new film project, as he would do on witnessing the statue of Nataraja on his visit to CERN - a hub of complex particle accelerators.
<br></br> 
Gazing stars with his telescope like a curious kid, an avid reader and a crazy lord shiva fanatic.
Sushant Singh Rajput - A true polymath
<br></br> 
A creative projection of photon's duality blends well with his exceptional life.</h4>
